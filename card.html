			<p id = "interesting_fact">All octopuses are thought to have some venom that comes from bacteria living inside the animals. Most don't have enough poison to harm people. But a bite from a small blue-ringed octopus can paralyze a human adult in minutes.</p>

			<p>The octopus is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. It has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. It has no internal or external skeleton (although some species have a vestigial remnant of a shell inside their mantles), allowing it to squeeze through tight places. Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>
